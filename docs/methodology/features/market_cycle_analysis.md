📘 Lecture: The Bitcoin 4-Year Market Cycle

The Bitcoin market is widely understood to follow a quasi-predictable four-year cycle driven by a combination of protocol design, human psychology, and macro liquidity regimes.
While not perfectly periodic, this pattern has repeated with remarkable consistency across Bitcoin’s history.

1. The Origin: The Halving Mechanism

Bitcoin’s protocol reduces the block reward by 50% every 210,000 blocks, roughly every 4 years.
This event is called the Halving.

Why the Halving Matters:

Miner revenue is instantly cut in half.

Newly issued supply entering the market decreases dramatically.

If demand stays the same, price tends to rise to rebalance the supply–demand curve.

This scheduled shock creates the backbone of the multi-year cycle.

2. The Four Phases of the Bitcoin Macro Cycle

Historically, the 4-year cycle can be divided into four macro phases, each with distinct behavioral, on-chain, and market characteristics.

Phase 1 — Accumulation (Post-Bear Bottom)

Timeframe: ~12–18 months before the Halving

Key Dynamics:

Price is depressed after a capitulation event.

Market sentiment is extremely negative.

Long-term holders begin aggressive accumulation.

Volatility decreases as sellers are exhausted.

Quant Indicators:

MVRV deep undervaluation

RUP negative or near zero

SOPR < 1 (investors selling at a loss)

Low realized volatility

Interpretation:
Smart money accumulates while retail loses interest.

Phase 2 — Pre-Halving Rally

Timeframe: 6–9 months leading to the Halving

Key Dynamics:

Market reawakens slowly.

New demand begins entering cautiously.

Narrative: “Halving is coming.”

Quant Indicators:

MVRV rising toward fair value

Price retests the 200-day MA from above

Miner Position Index stabilizes

Interpretation:
The market begins to price in the supply shock before it occurs.

Phase 3 — Post-Halving Expansion (Parabolic Phase)

Timeframe: 12–18 months after the Halving

Key Dynamics:

New supply entering the market is cut in half.

Demand begins to exceed supply aggressively.

Media coverage returns → new retail inflows.

Price accelerates into exponential growth.

Quant Indicators:

MVRV overheated

MM > 2.4 (Mayer Multiple)

Long-term holders distribute to new holders

Funding rates rise; derivatives open interest climbs

Interpretation:
This is the bull market, where ROI is largest but risk also increases.

Phase 4 — Distribution → Bear Market

Timeframe: 12–18 months following the bull peak

Key Dynamics:

Big players (whales, long-term holders) sell into euphoria.

Price becomes extremely overextended.

Derivatives become overcrowded.

Macro liquidity tightens (Fed hikes, etc.)

Eventually, a major flush or capitulation occurs.

Quant Indicators:

SOPR > 1 but rolling over

RUP extremely positive (blood zone)

MVRV > 2.5–3.5 (overheated)

Realized losses accelerate as panic begins

Interpretation:
The market unwinds excess leverage and enters a long, painful downtrend.
