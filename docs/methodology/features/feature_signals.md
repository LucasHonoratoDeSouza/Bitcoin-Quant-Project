1. Relative Unrealized Profit (RUP)

Definition:
RUP = (Unrealized Profit) / (Market Cap)

Where unrealized profit = sum of (Market Price - Realized Price) for UTXOs in profit.

Effect:

High RUP → market in profit euphoria → higher crash probability.

Low RUP → strong accumulation environment.

2. MVRV Ratio

Definition:
MVRV = Market Cap / Realized Cap

Effect:

High MVRV (>3 historically) → overheated / bubble risk.

Low MVRV (<1) → market trading below cost basis → strong long-term accumulation zone.

3. MVRV Crosses (Short-Term vs Long-Term Value)

Definition:
Cross = MVRV_short - MVRV_long

Where:

MVRV_short = Market Cap / Realized Cap (short-term holders)

MVRV_long = Market Cap / Realized Cap (long-term holders)

Effect:

Positive cross → short-term holders outperform → bull acceleration.

Negative cross → long-term holders outperform → bearish risk regime.

4. SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio)

Definition:
SOPR = (Price at spend) / (Price at creation)

Interpretation:

SOPR = 1 → coins moved at break-even

SOPR > 1 → coins sold in profit

SOPR < 1 → coins sold in loss

Effect:

SOPR < 1 → capitulation regime → long bias improves.

SOPR > 1 and rising → profit-taking pressure may cap upside.

5. Mayer Multiple (MM)

Definition:
MM = Price / 200-day Moving Average

Effect:

MM > 2.4 → historically overextended → reduces long exposure.

MM < 1 → undervaluation → strong long-term entry zone.

6. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

Definition:
EMA applies exponentially decreasing weights to past prices, emphasizing recent market movements.

effect:

Price > EMA with rising slope → strengthens bull signal.

Price < EMA with falling slope → increases bear signals.

Large deviation between price and EMA → warns of trend exhaustion (overextension).

7. Global Liquidity Index (GLI)

Definition:
GLI = f(Fed Balance Sheet, ECB Balance Sheet, BOJ Liquidity, global M2)

Exact formula varies; typically normalized:

GLI_z = (GLI_t - mean(GLI)) / std(GLI)

Effect:

Rising global liquidity → strong risk-on environment.

Falling liquidity → risk-off → reduces long exposure.

8. Interest Rates (Fed Funds Rate)

Definition:
Simply the federal funds effective rate (FFR).

Effect:

Rising rates → macro headwind → suppresses long-term BTC upside.

Falling rates → bullish liquidity expansion.

9. Inflation (CPI Year-over-Year)

Definition:
CPI_yoy = (CPI_t - CPI_t-12months) / CPI_t-12months

Effect:

High inflation with rising rates → risk-off environment.

Declining inflation → supports long-term allocation into BTC.

10. Dollar Strength Index (DXY)

Definition:
DXY = weighted index of USD vs global currencies.

Effect:

Rising DXY → BTC tends to weaken (liquidity contraction).

Falling DXY → BTC tailwind (liquidity expansion).
