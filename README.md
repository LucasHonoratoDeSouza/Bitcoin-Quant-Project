# 🏦 Bitcoin Quant Project
### Institutional-Grade Algorithmic Trading System

> **"Discipline of a Robot, Intelligence of a Quant."**

## 🚀 Value Proposition
Investing in Bitcoin is volatile. Emotional decisions—buying the top due to FOMO or selling the bottom due to panic—are the #1 destroyer of capital.

This project solves that problem by replacing **emotion** with **math**.

We have built a sophisticated **Quantitative Engine** that analyzes the market from every angle (On-Chain Data, Macroeconomics, Derivatives, Sentiment) to make objective, high-probability capital allocation decisions.

> **🎯 Investment Horizon**: **Medium to Long Term**.
> This system is designed for **Wealth Accumulation**, not high-frequency day trading. It aims to catch major market cycles (months to years) while protecting capital during multi-year bear markets.

## 🧠 Core Technology

### 1. The Analytical Engine (QuantScorer)
Every day, the system ingests millions of data points to answer one question: **"What is the risk/reward ratio today?"**
*   **On-Chain Analysis**: Are long-term holders selling? Is the network growing?
*   **Macroeconomics**: Interest rates, Inflation (CPI), Dollar Strength (DXY).
*   **Market Sentiment**: Fear & Greed, Volatility.
*   **Derivatives**: Funding Rates, Open Interest.

### 2. The Risk Manager (Portfolio Manager)
The engine doesn't just say "Buy" or "Sell". It manages **Risk**.
*   **Accumulation**: Slowly buying when the market is undervalued.
*   **Sniper Mode (Scalp)**: Taking quick profits during short-term rallies.
*   **Capital Preservation**: Moving to Cash (USD) when risk is extreme.
*   **Smart Leverage**: Only borrowing (up to 2x) when conditions are "Perfect" (>80/100 Score).

### 3. The Ledger (Auditable Accounting)
Transparency is key. The system maintains a permanent, immutable record of every decision.
*   **Daily Reports**: Detailed snapshots of Equity, ROI, and Alpha.
*   **Order Book**: A CSV log of every trade executed.
*   **Paper Trading**: A simulation mode to validate performance before risking real capital.
